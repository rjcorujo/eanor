Eanor needs Swiprolog to be installed:

Unix:
- Install swiprolog
- Needs libswipl to be compiled as a shared library:

Get the source: http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable/src/pl-5.10.1.tar.gz

Extract the tarball and edit build.templ as follows: Set PREFIX:

PREFIX=/usr
SUDO="sudo"
Select Packages:
export DISABLE_PKGS="ssl odbc xpce zlib"
Additional packages may be disabled (as long as JPL stays enabled, of course) or any of the 4 above may be enabled. However xpce and zlib are known to cause problems in some environments and are not needed for naproche anyway. And create a shared library. Add:
EXTRACFG+=" --enable-shared"
Make sure every one of the options above is uncommented.

Then run build.templ. (Despite setting SUDO in most cases the script needs to be called as root)

Afterwards there should be a "jpl.jar" in /usr/lib/swipl-5.10.1/lib and libswipl.so in /usr/lib/swipl-5.10.1/lib/i686-linux
